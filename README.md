Most online tutorials are needlessly complicated. The purpose of this website is to get you up and running with popular AI algorithms without needing a Ph.D. in computer science. 

# How to use this repository
Navigate to the subdirectory of the example that you want to explore. Each subdirectory contains:

- `README.md` with instructions for running that example.
- Dockerfile
- Source code with `.py` extension
- Same source code as a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` extension)
- `ruh.sh`, which launches a Docker container and runs the `.py` file
